term: Link
description: A fully-qualified HTTP address for a particular resource (e.g., "http://my.api.com/v1/resources/resource-name"). RESTful APIs by definition should provide links from a resource to all related resources and collections which provide subsequent actions using the resource. This allows for an API to be traversed organically and for an application developer to ensure his API Client is not in (as much) jeopardy if a resource's location changed.
